## There is 3 programs build in this directory 

### 1) Get News from Hackers News website and then send mail using gmail smtp to user (self or anyone)
### 2) Download Any TedTalk Video with the link of its website, we are finding .mp4 extension in it and downloading it. We enhanced the program to use it by cli command (with url as parameter)
